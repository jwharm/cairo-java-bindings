# Cairo Java bindings
Java language bindings for the [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org) graphics library using the 
new JEP-454 Foreign Function & Memory API. The bindings are based on **cairo 1.18.0** and work with **JDK 22** and newer.

I created these language bindings primarily as a companion to the GObject-Introspection-based Java 
language bindings for Gtk and GStreamer generated with [Java-GI](https://github.com/jwharm/java-gi), but they can also be used independently.

## Overview

### Java API

In general, the Java bindings match the cairo C API, but with a Java "coding style". C structs like 
`cairo_t`, `cairo_surface_t` and `cairo_matrix_t` are modeled with Java proxy 
classes like `Context`, `Surface` and `Matrix`, and all flags and enumerations are 
available as Java enums. The proxy classes inherit when applicable: `RadialGradient` extends 
`Gradient`, which extends `Pattern`, and `ImageSurface` extends `Surface`. Types, 
functions and parameters follow Java (camel case) naming practices, so 
`cairo_move_to(*cr, x, y)` becomes `cr.moveTo(x, y)`. Out-parameters in the C API 
are mapped to return values in Java. Multiple out parameters (like coordinates) are mapped to a 
`Point`, `Circle`, `Rect` or `RGBA` return type in Java.

### Resource allocation and disposal

Most resources are allocated and deallocated automatically, so there is no need to manually dispose 
cairo resources in Java as would be the case in C with the various `cairo_..._destroy()` functions.
However, please be aware that the disposal of these objects (like Context) is initiated by the Java 
garbage collector, which does not know about the native resources, and might wait an indefinite 
amount of time before the objects are effectively disposed. Therefore, manual calls to `destroy()` 
are still possible in case the automatic cleanup during GC is not sufficient to prevent resource 
exhaustion.

Some data types (like Matrix and TextExtents) must be allocated by the client; the `create()` 
methods for these classes have an `Arena` parameter. Consult the JDK documentation to choose the 
optimal type of Arena for your use case.

The `Surface` and `Device` classes implement `AutoCloseable` and are preferably used in 
try-with-resources blocks. (The `close()` method calls the C `cairo_..._finish()` function.)

### Error handling

Cairo status codes are checked in the language binding, and throw exceptions 
(IllegalStateException, IllegalArgumentException or IOException) with the detailed status 
description (from `cairo_status_to_string()`). The exceptions are documented in the 
Javadoc, except for the `CAIRO_STATUS_NO_MEMORY` status, which is not documented and will 
throw a RuntimeException if it occurs. If your application consumes a lot of memory, add try-catch 
blocks for this situation where applicable.

### Other notable features

Some other features that the language bindings offer:

* In the `Context`, `Surface` and `Pattern` classes (like `Mesh`), methods that return 
  `void` in the C API, return `this` in Java, to allow method chaining.

* The `Path` class is iterable, and path traversal is implemented with `PathElement` 
  objects. The `PathElement` type is a sealed interface implemented by a record type for every 
  path operation. They can be iterated and processed with record patterns (JEP 440). See the 
  `Path` class javadoc for example code.

* I/O operations in cairo that are designed to work with streams accept Java `InputStream` and 
  `OutputStream` parameters.
  
* The cairo Script surface has been split into a `Script` class that inherits from 
  `Device`, and a `ScriptSurface` class that inherits from `Surface`.

* The functions for reading and comparing cairo version information are available in Java as static 
  methods in the `Cairo` class.

* Basic functionality is included to load fonts with FreeType2 for use with cairo.

## API Documentation

All API documentation is available as Javadoc, and has been reworked to use Javadoc syntax and 
cross-reference between Java classes and methods. You can 
[lookup the Javadoc online](https://jwharm.github.io/cairo-java-bindings/javadoc/), or download 
the javadoc or sources jar to use in your IDE.

## License

The bindings are available to be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of  the GNU Lesser 
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 (which is also one of the licenses of cairo itself.)

## Usage

The library is available on Maven Central. Include it in your `gradle.build` or `pom.xml` file:

```
dependencies {
  implementation 'io.github.jwharm.cairobindings:cairo:1.18.4.2'
}
```

Furthermore, you obviously need to have the cairo library version 1.18 installed on your system, 
or else the Java bindings have nothing to bind to. You also need to use JDK 22 or newer.

Now, you can start developing with cairo in Java. Have fun! This is a simple example to get started, 
ported from [the first sample on this page](https://www.cairographics.org/samples/):

```java
import org.freedesktop.cairo.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CairoExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Create surface
        try (var surface = ImageSurface.create(Format.ARGB32, 300, 300)) {

            // Create drawing context
            var cr = Context.create(surface);

            double x = 128.0;
            double y = 128.0;
            double radius = 100.0;
            double angle1 = 45.0 * (Math.PI / 180.0);  // angles are specified
            double angle2 = 180.0 * (Math.PI / 180.0); // in radians

            // Draw shapes
            cr.setLineWidth(10.0)
              .arc(x, y, radius, angle1, angle2)
              .stroke();

            cr.setSourceRGBA(1.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.6)
              .setLineWidth(6.0)
              .arc(x, y, 10.0, 0.0, 2 * Math.PI)
              .fill();

            cr.arc(x, y, radius, angle1, angle1)
              .lineTo(x, y)
              .arc(x, y, radius, angle2, angle2)
              .lineTo(x, y)
              .stroke();

            // Write image to png file
            surface.writeToPNG("example.png");
        }
    }
}
```

When compiling and running the application, suppress warnings about unsafe native 
access with the command-line parameter `--enable-native-access=org.freedesktop.cairo`.
