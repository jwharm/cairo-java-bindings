     * <p>
     * The foreground marker pattern contains an internal marker to indicate that it
     * is to be substituted with the current source when rendered to a surface.
     * Querying the foreground marker will reveal a solid black color, however this
     * is not representative of the color that will actually be used. Similarly,
     * setting a solid black color will render black, not the foreground pattern
     * when the glyph is painted to a surface. Using the foreground marker as the
     * source instead of {@link #getForegroundSource()} in a color render callback
     * has the following benefits:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Cairo only needs to call the render callback once as it can cache the
     * recording. Cairo will substitute the actual foreground color when rendering
     * the recording.
     * <li>On backends that have the concept of a foreground color in fonts such as PDF,
     * PostScript, and SVG, cairo can generate more optimal output. The glyph can be
     * included in an embedded font.
     * </ol>
     * The one drawback of the using foreground marker is the render callback can
     * not access the color components of the pattern as the actual foreground
     * pattern is not available at the time the render callback is invoked. If the
     * render callback needs to query the foreground pattern, use
     * {@link #getForegroundSource()}.
     * <p>
     * If the render callback simply wants to call {@link Context#getSource()} with the
     * foreground pattern, {@code getForegroundMarker} is the
     * preferred function to use as it results in better performance than
     * {@link #getForegroundSource()}.
     *
     * @return the current foreground source marker pattern. This object must not be
     *         modified or used outside of a color render callback.

     * callback is free to query the pattern and extract color components or other
